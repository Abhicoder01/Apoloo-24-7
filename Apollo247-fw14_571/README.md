# Apollo247
Apollo 24|7 is an online plateform where you have access to some services such as online pharmacy, online doctor consultations and diagnostic lab tests at home.
Introduction
I got the task to create a clone of “Appolo247.com” and show my skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript which i have learnt till now at Masai School.
How i created the page
First, i have just decided how should i start it by adding important parts of the website in this short span of time.
For the same, i have just started it step by step by dividing part of the website.
After completing that, i just tried to add some more styles and functionality to the page and then just merge it together.
Challenges i faced during project is lots more but after completing my work step by step i am just got lots of confident.
After that using Git-Hub and pull the codes and then, merging it together was lil difficult in start.
The most importantly, adding all the JavaSript functionality to make a website is very time taking.
Overall Experience
It was a very nice to work.
So as an doing individual project is very new for me and i am also enjoying this.
And i just successfully created Apollo 24/7 clone website.
